# [Nedflix](http://nedflix.net/)

Nedflix is a website inspired by Film State's old watch/talk segment. Nedflix is a weekly watch/discuss that suggests a new film or hidden gem from within the Netflix library. Watch and then return to discuss with others who have watched the film.

Nedflix is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and if you are curious to know my thoughts on Working with Jekyll, you can read them [here](http://nedf23.com/working-with-jekyll/).
